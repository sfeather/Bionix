# Bionix
A robot that helps people with disabilities (components: arduino, ultrasonic sensor HCSR04,
bluetooth module, robotic arm - 6 servomotors, chassis - 4 DC motors, a webcam)
developed with one of my high school classmates. The project included a desktop
application made in C Sharp that can control the robot through a bluetooth connection
between the laptop and the robot. All the code and interfaces from the desktop app
were made by us.
